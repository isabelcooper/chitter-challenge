Technical Approach:
-----

Integrate the database using the `PG` gem and `SQL` queries.

Possible extension: 
If you'd like more technical challenge this weekend, try using an [Object Relational Mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) as the database interface.

Some useful resources:
**DataMapper**
- [DataMapper ORM](https://datamapper.org/)
- [Sinatra, PostgreSQL & DataMapper recipe](http://recipes.sinatrarb.com/p/databases/postgresql-datamapper)

**ActiveRecord**
- [ActiveRecord ORM](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
- [Sinatra, PostgreSQL & ActiveRecord recipe](http://recipes.sinatrarb.com/p/databases/postgresql-activerecord?#article)


Notes on functionality:
------

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.

Bonus:
-----

If you have time you can implement the following:

* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.

And/Or:

* Work on the CSS to make it look good.


Usage
-----

#Set up local database & table

1. Open psql postgres
2. CREATE DATABASE chitter;
3. Run file: 01.Create_peeps_table_.sql

4. Confirm it appears as expected:
```
=# \dt
        List of relations
 Schema | Name  | Type  | Owner
--------+-------+-------+--------
 public | peeps | table | Isabel
(1 row)
```

And test database:
5. CREATE DATABASE chitter_testing;
6. Run file: 02.Create_peeps_testing_table_.sql
